# Advent of code preparator ðŸŽ„ ðŸŽ…

This scripts makes it possible to download a puzzle of a specific day and year of the Advent of Code challenges.  
The user needs to set their session cookie in the script so that the puzzles can be accessed.

## Script parameter
* -y select the year (2015 until now)
* -d select the day (Day 1 until 25)
* -a download all days of a specific year
* -l select the programming language you want to use
* -c (optional) set your session cookie (the session cookie can also be set in [config.py](./config.py))
* -p (optional) path to the output directory
* -h help

## Folder structure
The script also generates a **folder structure** based on the selected year and day and a basic **source code file**, so that no manual setup is necessary:
* The basic source code file reads in the input and prints it out
* The generated folders and files have the following structure:

```bash
    root/  
    â””â”€â”€ AoC_[Year]  
        â””â”€â”€ [Day]_[Language]  
             â”œâ”€â”€ [Day]_01  
             |      â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt  
             |      â””â”€â”€ 10_01.[Language]  
             â””â”€â”€ [Day]_02  
                    â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt  
                    â””â”€â”€ 10_02.[Language]  
```
  Example: `python prepareAoC.py -y 2019 -d 10 -l c`
```bash
    root/  
    â””â”€â”€ AoC_2019   
        â””â”€â”€ 10_c  
             â”œâ”€â”€ 10_01  
             |      â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt  
             |      â””â”€â”€ 10_01.c  
             â””â”€â”€ 10_02  
                    â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt  
                    â””â”€â”€ 10_02.c  
```
