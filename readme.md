# Advent of code Preparator ðŸŽ„ ðŸŽ…

This scripts makes it possible to download a puzzle of a specific day and year of the Advent of Code challenges.  
The user needs to set their session cookie in the script so that the puzzles can be accessed.

Possible selections:  
**Years:** &ensp; 2015 .. year of last christmas  
**Days:** &ensp; 1 .. 25

The script also generates a **folder structure** based on the selected year and day and a basic **source code file**, so that no manual setup is necessary:
* The basic source code file reads in the input and prints it out
* The generated folders and files have the following structure:
```bash
    root/  
    â””â”€â”€ AoC_[Year]  
        â””â”€â”€ [Day]_[Language]  
             â”œâ”€â”€ [Day]_01  
             |      â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt  
             |      â””â”€â”€ 10_01.[Language]  
             â””â”€â”€ [Day]_02  
                    â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt  
                    â””â”€â”€ 10_02.[Language]  
```
  Example: `python prepareAoC.py -y 2019 -d 10 -l c`
```bash
    root/  
    â””â”€â”€ AoC_2019   
        â””â”€â”€ 10_c  
             â”œâ”€â”€ 10_01  
             |      â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt  
             |      â””â”€â”€ 10_01.c  
             â””â”€â”€ 10_02  
                    â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt  
                    â””â”€â”€ 10_02.c
